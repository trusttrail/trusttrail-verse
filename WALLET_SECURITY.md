# Wallet Security Implementation

## Security Issue Addressed

**FIXED**: User wallet addresses were previously exposed to public access through overly permissive RLS policies on the `wallet_profiles` table.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Database Level Security
- ✅ **Removed overly permissive RLS policy** that allowed `SELECT` with `USING (true)`
- ✅ **Implemented targeted access policy** that works with application-level restrictions
- ✅ **Added security documentation** at the database level
- ✅ **Created security functions** with proper search_path settings

### 2. Application Level Security
- ✅ **Created secure wallet utility module** (`src/utils/walletSecurity.ts`)
- ✅ **Implemented input validation** for wallet addresses
- ✅ **Added address format verification** (hex format validation)
- ✅ **Enforced targeted queries only** - no bulk data extraction allowed
- ✅ **Updated existing code** to use secure functions
- ✅ **Added comprehensive error handling** and logging

### 3. Code Changes Made
- **Updated**: `src/utils/formSubmission.ts` - Now uses secure wallet profile operations
- **Created**: `src/utils/walletSecurity.ts` - Secure wallet profile utilities
- **Enhanced**: Database RLS policies with better security model

## Current Security Model

### What is Protected ✅
- **No bulk wallet extraction**: Cannot query all wallet addresses at once
- **Targeted access only**: Must provide specific wallet address to query
- **Input validation**: All wallet addresses are validated for proper format
- **Secure operations**: All wallet profile operations go through secure functions
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages without exposing sensitive data

### What is Allowed ✅
- **Legitimate lookups**: Applications can find profiles by specific wallet address
- **Profile creation**: New wallet profiles can be created securely
- **Review association**: Reviews can be linked to wallet profiles properly

## Remaining Configuration Tasks

### Authentication Configuration (Supabase Dashboard)

⚠️ **Action Required**: The following need to be configured in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **OTP Expiry Settings**
   - Navigate to: Authentication → Settings
   - Reduce OTP expiry time to recommended threshold
   - [Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#security)

2. **Password Breach Protection**
   - Navigate to: Authentication → Settings → Password Security
   - Enable "Leaked password protection"
   - [Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only allow access to specific data needed
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all wallet addresses before processing
3. **Secure by Design**: No functions that allow bulk data extraction
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages without data leakage
5. **Documentation**: Clear security documentation and warnings
6. **Logging**: Comprehensive security-focused logging

## Testing the Security Fix

### Before (Vulnerable)
```sql
-- This would have shown all wallet addresses
SELECT * FROM wallet_profiles;
```

### After (Secure)
```typescript
// This is the only allowed pattern - targeted lookup
const profile = await findWalletProfileByAddress('0xSpecificAddress...');
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Monitor logs** for any unusual query patterns
- **Review security regularly** as the application grows
- **Update dependencies** to get latest security patches
- **Audit wallet operations** periodically

## Compliance

This implementation helps ensure:
- **User privacy protection**: Wallet addresses are not publicly enumerable
- **Data minimization**: Only necessary data is accessible
- **Secure access patterns**: All queries are validated and logged
- **Best practice compliance**: Following established security patterns
